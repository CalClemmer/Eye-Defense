==========================================================
Ideas: 
1. Tower defense game
2. Enemies are Shapes 
    2a. Different shapes can do different things 
3. Towers fight the shapes. Players place towers. 
    3a. Towers shoot at shapes. 
    3b. Ideally, 
4. Shapes move from left of screen to the right
    4a. If shapes get all the way to the right player loses 


Buglist: 
1. Returns console error if bullet is spawned on top of enemy triangle
