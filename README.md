==========================================================
Ideas: 
1. Tower defense game
2. Enemies are Shapes 
    2a. Different shapes can do different things 
3. Towers fight the shapes. Players place towers. 
    3a. Towers shoot at shapes. 
4. Shapes move from left of screen to the right
    4a. If shapes get all the way to the right player loses

Buglist: 

Ideas: 
1. could spawn "ghost shapes" off screen that don't fully load in till they reach screen, then all the shapes could be loaded with a single position array...? Or I could just randomly spawn shapes in. Or both?
2. loading screen can be made with a bunch of shapes 

Enemy Ideas:
1. Circle becomes bomb once it's hit? Maybe circle bounces when it's hit like a shield? 
2. Shape that splits? 
3. Shape that shoots at Turrets? 

Turret Ideas:
1. Money Turrets
2. Sniper Turrets 
3. Short Range Turrets 
4. Booster Turrets that Boost turrets around it? 
5. Shield Turrets? 
6. Laser Turret?
